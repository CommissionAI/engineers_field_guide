# Checking In

As you get used to a new team, a new product, and maybe some new tools, it is useful to get your bearings from time to time.
Check-ins are a way for Spiff to know what is important to you and for you to know what is important to Spiff.
Check-ins are a one-on-one meeting between you and the CTO that happen every 3 months.
If you forget, the CTO will remind you. If the CTO forgets, you should remind them.

During a check-in all topics are fair game, but a few topics should always be addressed.

* How do you feel about the team, company, product and CTO? Are you noticing any systemic problems or things that should be course-corrected?
* How does the CTO feel about your performance on the team? Are you getting projects done? Are you helping others on the team?

There are a few general metrics that might be considered while assessing your performance such as numbers of PRs and github activity (including feedback on issues and other peoples' PRs).
These metrics are like a smoke test.
As long as the metrics are roughly in-line with the rest of your team, they probably won't get discussed much.

The more important metrics are the ones you bring to the discussion.
