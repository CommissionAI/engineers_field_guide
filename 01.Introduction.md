# The Engineers Field Guide

Engineering is inherently a creative pursuit.
This field guide is not intended to tell you what to do as an engineer, it is only meant point out a few common pitfalls and best practices.
Not telling you how to do your job is something you are going to hear a lot about.
In reality you know more about your own skills, experiences and strengths than anyone else.
In an ideal world, each person at Spiff would be doing the _most valuable_ thing they could possibly be doing each day.
You are the person who can best choose what that is for you today.

If you aren't sure what is most valuable, you might go talk to the product team to see what things they want to get done.
You might try to catch lunch with someone from the sales team, or sit with a support person while they are helping users.
You might read an article or study that relates to sales teams and finance teams.
If you have no idea what to do next, just ask the `#dev` channel in slack and you'll be bound to hear about someone needing help.
Whatever source of information you use, make sure you are doing something each day that will make life better for the people using our software in the long run.
